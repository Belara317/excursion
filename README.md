## Description
n this project, you’ll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” You’ll use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. You’ll be proud of yourself when it all comes together!

The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

## Installation
 * Open your command line interface. Make sure your current working directory matches your expectations. Make a new directory called excursion.
 * Make sure your current working directory is excursion and then initialize a Git repository.
 * Let’s set up a remote GitHub repository. Go to GitHub’s homepage to make a new repository. Call it excursion. Follow the instructions to add an existing Git repository, since you have already initialized yours on your own computer.

* After you pushed to your remote repository, refresh your repository page on GitHub. You should see your new files(index.html and style.css)
